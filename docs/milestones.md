# Milestones

One entry per milestone: what was done, what changed along the way, and open questions.

## M1. Core IR and interpreter

**Done**

- `a0-diag`: source map, spans, diagnostics with rustc-style rendering. Shared by every layer.
- `a0-ir`: the structured IR described in `docs/ir.md`, written down before the code.
  - Builder with matched `if_`/`else_`/`end_if` and `loop_`/`end_loop` calls, mutable variables, and
    automatic unique naming. Misuse becomes a diagnostic, never a panic.
  - Text format with an exact round-trip guarantee, tested byte for byte on a file that uses every
    opcode, every float edge case (`-0.0`, `inf`, `nan(0x...)`, `1e300`) and quoted names.
  - Verifier for types, value scoping, call signatures, variables, `break`/`continue` placement and
    termination of non-void functions. Diagnostics point at the text when there is one.
- `a0-runtime`: the C runtime (lifecycle, traps, output, memory, time) as a static library, a symbol
  table for the interpreter, and `a0_ffi_call`, a generated trampoline for calling C from Rust.
- `a0-interp`: compiles functions to a slot-resolved op tree, runs them on a shared stack with real
  host memory, calls C through the trampoline, reports traps as values and bounds recursion depth.
- `a0`: `check`, `fmt` and `run` subcommands.
- Tests: unit tests per crate and `tests/programs`, a corpus of IR programs with expected stdout,
  stderr and exit status, run end to end through `a0 run`.

**Changed**

- Rust was not installed on the development machine; it was installed with `rustup` (stable,
  MSVC toolchain) after asking.
- The text format grew `nan(0x...)` to keep NaN payloads exact, and all-digit names are reserved for
  unnamed values so that names, not internal ids, are what round-trips.
- IR traps (division by zero, `unreachable`) are checked explicitly so that the interpreter and native
  code print the same message and exit with the same status (101).

**Open questions**

1. *C-bindability.* D2 in `docs/decisions.md` spells out how "no Rust-specific types in public
   signatures" was interpreted: `&self`, `&str`/`&[T]` inputs and borrowed `&str`/`&[Handle]` returns
   are allowed, lifetimes on types, generics, closures and data-carrying enums are not. Is that the
   intended line?
2. *Interpreter FFI limits.* Calls from the interpreter to C support up to 8 integer/pointer/`f64`
   arguments; `f32` arguments and results are rejected with a diagnostic. Native code has no such limit.
   Good enough until a language needs more?
3. *Small integer arguments to C.* IR integers are signless, so `i8`/`i16` arguments to C functions are
   not extended according to the C type's signedness. This only matters for C functions with `char` or
   `short` parameters (and on Apple AArch64). Frontends should pass `i32`/`i64`.
